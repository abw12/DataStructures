    //if we introduced an instance variable like below it create a problem and you'll observe few numbers are being skipped by each thread
    //this happens bcoz as we know each thread has his own thread stack but each thread share the same heap memory of the process
    //so the instance variable get stored in heap memory of the process they both share the same value of i if we are passing the same countdown
    // instance to both the countdownthread instances above and so i keep decrementing it on execution of the respective thread
    //so when an threads get suspended after execution it has already decremented the value of i in the heap memory and therefore the other thread get the
    //different value then what it has when it got suspended before
    //this situation is race condition or interfering thread
    //to overcome this we can create two separate obj/instances of the countdown class and pass different instance to the countdown thread class
    //although this approach is not recommended in real world app as creating separate obj may result in unexpected behaviour based on business logic
    //better approach here is to use synchronized method or synchronized block of code as it only allow one thread to access the object at one time
