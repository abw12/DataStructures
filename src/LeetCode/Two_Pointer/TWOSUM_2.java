/*Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order,
find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

        Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

        The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

        Your solution must use only constant extra space.*/

/*Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
        Output: [1,2]
        Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].*/
